3. Core loop: - Greet the next walk-in and review a simple flash design (quick choice: small / medium / bold).
- Place the stencil on the body area (align + confirm).
- Tattoo the design: trace linework and add one pass of shading/fill.
- Manage the client’s pain by wiping/cooling at the right moments (and by not messing up).
- Finish, apply aftercare wrap, mark tattoo complete (progress + move to next client).
4. Level design overview (locations and flow)
