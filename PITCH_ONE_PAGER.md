# Inkline — Pitch One Pager

## Hook (1 sentence)
Run the needle, keep your hand steady, and finish three walk-in tattoos before your client’s pain tops out.

## Player Fantasy
Be the calm, precise tattoo artist who can pull clean lines under pressure while reading the room and earning trust in a gritty little shop.
You feel the satisfaction of “perfect linework” and the tension of one slip turning the session sideways.

## Core Loop (10-15 min slice)
- Greet the next walk-in and review a simple flash design (quick choice: small / medium / bold).
- Place the stencil on the body area (align + confirm).
- Tattoo the design: trace linework and add one pass of shading/fill.
- Manage the client’s pain by wiping/cooling at the right moments (and by not messing up).
- Finish, apply aftercare wrap, mark tattoo complete (progress + move to next client).

## Differentiators
- Tattooing as a **precision skill game**: linework feels tactile and “craft-like” without turning into a sim spreadsheet.
- A single rising **Pain** pressure meter creates real tension and forces smart pacing (wipe now vs push the line).
- Short, character-driven walk-ins: each client has a vibe, a boundary, and a reason they’re here—without long cutscenes.

## Target Platform
PC (mouse) first, with controller support (Steam Deck friendly).

## Comparables + Why We Win
- *Papers, Please* (high-stakes work loop) + *PowerWash Simulator* (satisfying “clean completion”) energy, but with a tighter “don’t slip” skill core.
- We win by making the act of tattooing feel **visceral and readable** in under 15 minutes: trace, breathe, wipe, finish.

## Scope Guardrails
- No open world
- No economy/currency
- No crafting tree
- 3-5 interactions max
- 1 pressure system, 1 progress metric
