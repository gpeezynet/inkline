# Inkline — Presentation Brief

## Audience
- Indie investors / small publishers
- Vertical-slice collaborators (programmer + artist)
- Streamers who like satisfying skill loops

## 30-Second Pitch
Inkline is a tattoo-parlor precision game: pull clean lines, manage client pain, and finish three walk-ins in one shift. It’s satisfying when you nail it—and tense when you don’t.

## 2-Minute Talk Track
You play a tattoo artist on a busy walk-in shift. Each tattoo is the same tight loop: stencil placement, linework, quick shading, aftercare. The pressure system is a single Pain meter—mistakes and hesitation spike it, wiping/cooling buys you a little space, and if it maxes the client taps out and you fail the slice. The slice proves the core feel: the “needle” interaction is tactile, readable, and repeatable. Three clients ramp difficulty so we can test tuning quickly. No sim bloat—just one clean loop with tension.

## Core Loop (One Sentence)
Stencil → trace lines → shade → wipe/cool to manage pain → aftercare → repeat for 3 clients.

## What We Are NOT Doing
- No long-run management sim systems
- No shop decorating progression for the slice
- No sprawling feature pile beyond the tattoo loop

## Playtest Goals
- Does linework feel fair (forgiveness) and satisfying (feedback)?
- Is pain pressure readable and does it create real decisions?
- Can a new player finish in ~12 minutes without a tutorial wall?

## Ask / Next Step
Greenlight a 1–2 week prototype sprint to validate “linework feel,” pain tuning, and one polished booth scene with three client jobs.
